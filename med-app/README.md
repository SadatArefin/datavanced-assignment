## API Integration

The application integrates with a .NET Core Web API backend running on `https://localhost:5001/api`. The API provides endpoints for:

- **Appointments**: CRUD operations and PDF generation
- **Lookups**: Patients, doctors, and medicines data
- **Search & Pagination**: Server-side filtering and pagination

### API Endpoints Used

```
GET    /api/appointments           # List appointments with pagination
GET    /api/appointments/{id}      # Get specific appointment
POST   /api/appointments           # Create new appointment
PUT    /api/appointments/{id}      # Update appointment
DELETE /api/appointments/{id}      # Delete appointment
GET    /api/appointments/{id}/pdf  # Download prescription PDF
GET    /api/lookups/patients       # Get all patients
GET    /api/lookups/doctors        # Get all doctors
GET    /api/lookups/medicines      # Get all medicines
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- .NET Core Web API backend running on port 5001

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd med-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Angular Material** (if not already installed)

   ```bash
   ng add @angular/material
   ```

5. **Open the application**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser

### Backend Setup

Ensure the .NET Core Web API backend is running on `https://localhost:5001`. The frontend expects the following endpoints to be available:

- Appointments CRUD operations
- Patient, Doctor, and Medicine lookup endpoints
- PDF generation functionality

## Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Key Components

### AppointmentsListComponent

- Displays paginated list of appointments
